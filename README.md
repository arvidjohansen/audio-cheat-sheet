In the audio world, there are four signal levels that we deal with: mic, instrument, line, and speaker. These levels all have different meanings, so it is important to know the differences between them. Take a look below to learn about these different signal levels.

## Mic level
Example: Mic plugged in directly without preamp  
Mic level is the voltage of signal generated by a microphone. This is the lowest, or weakest, level signal of the four and requires a preamplifier to bring it up to line level.

## Instrument level
Example: Guitar plugged in directly without preamp  
Instrument level signals fall between mic level (lower) and line level (higher) signals. These signals refer to any level put out by an instrument, commonly from an electric guitar or bass. A preamplifier is required to bring the signal up to line level.

## Line level
Example: Output of your phone  
Line level signals are the highest level signals before amplification. This is the type of signal that typically flows through your recording system after the preamplifier stage and before the amplifier that powers your speakers. The two types of line levels are consumer and professional.

## Speaker level
Example: Output from your sound system to your speakers  
Consumer line level is rated around -10dBV and is what youâ€™ll find in products like a CD player.
Professional line level is rated around +4 dBu and can be found in equipment like mixing desks, preamplifiers, and signal processing equipment.
